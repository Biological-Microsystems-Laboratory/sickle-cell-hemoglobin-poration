# Sickle-Cell Hemoglobin Poration
This project aims to explore the effect of polymerizing Sickle-cell hemoglobin (HBs) on cell and/or liposome permeability.

## Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is the metalloprotein which carries oxygen in red blood cells.
It also transports carbon dioxide and nitric oxide.
Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is affected by concentration of carbon dioxide and 2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric acid as well as pH.
Low ph and high concentrations of carbon dioxide and 2,3-BPG decrease the affinity for oxygen binding, where, conversely, high pH, low concentration of carbon dioxide and 2,3-BPG increase affinity for oxygen binding.
In addition, each oxygen molecule that is bond increases the affinity for oxygen binding due to a conformational change resulting in a cooperative increase in affinity under high partial pressures of oxygen.
In this way high concentrations of oxygen lead to increased binding and low concentrations lead to de-saturation of oxygen from Hb.
